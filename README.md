# HoloDex
iOS App for a Modern Jedi

Data today cannot be provided by The Force. So instead, it's provided by Star Wars API, this app would not be possible without it. Thank you ‚ù§.

## About

HoloDex is an iOS app demonstrating my skills in creating an iOS from scrath that follows the following principles and practices:
* SOLID
* Reactive (Rx) with RxSwift library
* Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator

For dependency management, I've chosen to use Carthage so I can control the structure of the project workspace and I can learn more about how XCode projects and workspaces work with frameworks.

## Features

HoloDex is almost a 1:1 representation of what's available from the Star Wars API. The application is split into 5 core features:
1. Planets
2. Spaceships/Vehicles
3. People
4. Films
5. Species

Each of these features is represented by a tab within the application, so the user can seamlessly define their search into the Star Wars Universe (or better put, the Star Wars API). This is after all an all-knowing holocron for our modern era, amirite?
